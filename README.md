# Word Detective

## Expand Your Vocabulary Through Play!

Word Detective is an engaging and educational word game designed specifically for Adult ESL (English as a Second Language) learners. Inspired by the popular game Wordle, Word Detective goes a step further by focusing on words with multiple meanings, helping players expand their vocabulary and deepen their understanding of English language nuances.

### Game Concept

In Word Detective, players are challenged to guess a five-letter word based on given clues. What makes this game unique is that each word has multiple meanings or uses, and the clues provided reflect these different aspects of the word. This approach not only makes the game more challenging and interesting but also serves as a powerful learning tool for ESL students.

### How to Play

1. You have 5 attempts to guess the secret five-letter word.
2. Type your guess and press Enter.
3. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change:
   - Green: The letter is correct and in the right position.
   - Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - Grey: The letter is not in the word.
4. Use the clues provided to help you guess the word. Each clue represents a different meaning or use of the word.
